# SfQSM
SfQSM is a three-dimensional tree modeling method based on skeleton graph optimization and fractal self-similarity.This modeling method comprises three main steps: 
(1)Skeleton points self-adjusting based on geometric features;
(2)Edge weight definition for the tree graph;
(3)Fractal self-similarity optimization for individual tree modeling. 

Much more details of the SfQSM can be found from the article 《Self-adaptive Individual Tree Modeling Based on Skeleton Graph Optimization and Fractal Self-similarity》.

The SfQSM is written in Matlab R2022b. The main function is SfQSM.m, which takes in a point cloud and a structure array specifying the needed parameters.
